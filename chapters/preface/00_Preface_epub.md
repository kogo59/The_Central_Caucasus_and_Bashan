::: justified

THE FOLLOWING PAGES sufficiently explain how the journey described in them was
planned and carried out. In the course of our wanderings, we visited two
countries, well known, indeed, by name to the general reader, but concerning
which vague, and in some respects incorrect impressions are frequently
entertained. A truthful traveller may do as good service by destroying illusions
as by bringing forward fresh information, and I have felt bound to record our
conviction that the belief that there are ❛Giant Cities❜ in Bashan is as
unfounded as the still more prevalent idea that all the men in the Caucasus are
brave, and all the women beautiful.

Our Syrian travels owed their chief interest to a sudden access of vigour on the
part of the Turkish Pashas, which enabled us to visit, with little risk or
expense, the remarkable ruins of the Hauran and Lejah, and to form our own
opinion as to their date—a question as yet discussed principally by unskilled
witnesses, and still awaiting the decision of a competent judge. The exploration
of the passes and glaciers of the Central Caucasus, and the ascent of its two
most famous summits, formed the chief aim of our journey, and are the main
subject of the present volume. I trust that the record of our adventures in the
mountain fastnesses may prove of sufficient interest to draw the attention of
our countrymen to a range surpassing the Alps by two thousand feet in the
average height of its peaks, abounding in noble scenery and picturesque
inhabitants, and even now within the reach of many ❛long-vacation tourists❜ When
the Caucasus, as yet less known than the Andes or the Himalayas, becomes a
recognised goal of travel, this work will have fulfilled its object, and will be
superseded by the production of some author better qualified, both by literary
skill and scientific attainments, to treat of so noble a theme. The reader will
not find in these pages any political speculations, for which so rapid a journey
afforded scant opportunity ; he may more justly complain of the absence of
ethnological details concerning the tribes of the Caucasus. My excuse is, that
information filtered through an uneducated interpreter is difficult to obtain
and little trustworthy; the subject, moreover, has been fully treated of by
German travellers, in works already translated into English, and accessible to
those in whom the present account of the natural features of the Caucasian
region may raise a wish to learn more of its inhabitants.

The Map of the Central Caucasus is reduced from the Five Verst Map, executed by
the Russian Topographical Department at Tiflis, with many corrections suggested
by our own experience. The illustrations are derived from various sources; some
have been engraved from paintings by a Russian artist resident at Tiflis, others
are from photographs or pencil-sketches. Two of the smaller plates are borrowed
from a privately-printed work of Herr Radde, our numerous obligations to whom I
gladly take this opportunity of acknowledging.

I owe my best thanks to Mr. Edward Whymper for the skill he has shown in dealing
with the rough materials placed at his disposal, a task for which his well-known
knowledge of mountain scenery eminently qualified him. I have also to thank Mr.
Weller for the care he has taken to make the maps accurate and intelligible.

I cannot conclude these few words of preface without bearing grateful witness to
the constant encouragement, and very important aid, which I have received from
my companions, Mr. A. W. Moore and Mr. C. C. Tucker, in the preparation of the
volume now submitted to the public.
